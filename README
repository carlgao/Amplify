A web app that connects DJs, partygoers, and venue managers. It allows partygoers to rate the DJ and the music he's playing when they're at the party (authenticated based on location/event data), both manually and by using accelerometer data to sense how much they're movin' and shakin' (i.e. enjoying the music). We use our aggregated party hotness/energy metrics to allow DJs to know what songs they're deploying are most effective, and how they can best please the crowd. Thus, across DJs and venues, we can tell which parties are most poppin' and recommend them to partygoers who are looking for parties to go to. This is economically a win for venue managers because they now have nuanced analytics about their events as well as the DJs they hire (who are currently hired and judged essentially only by word of mouth).
